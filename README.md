# Marketing Campaign Classifier
**Predicting the success of Marketing Campaigns using Supervised Machine Learning.**

For this project I trained and compared results from 3 different classification algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines

Eventually I built an Ensemble Model, a Stacking Classifier, using as base estimators the 3 aforementioned models.
