# Marketing Campaign Classifier
Predicting the success of Marketing Campaigns using Supervised Machine Learning.
For this project I trained and compared results from 3 different classification algorithms:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
Eventually I built an Ensemble Model, a Stacked Classifier, using as base estimators the above 3 classification models.
